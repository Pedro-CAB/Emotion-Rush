# Emotion Rush

In Emotion Rush, you play as an adolescent that lives in a Residential Care institution and is about to join a new school, where you don’t know anyone and everything is new… Make new friends, participate in contests and learn more about yourself and others! But be careful… Do not be late for classes!

## Description

Emotion Rush is an arcade role-playing serious game developed with the intent of teaching Emotion Regulation to adolescents in Residential Care. In this game, players play as a new student in a school where they don’t know anyone. At the beginning of the game, the player receives an explanation of the basics on how the game works, through their institution caregiver:

-	Each day of classes has three breaks: the morning break, the lunch break and the afternoon break. Each of these breaks takes 10 real time minutes. During these breaks, the player can walk freely around school, interact with colleagues, receive situations to solve and work on solving them. Once the time ends, the bell rings and the player has to get back to class.

-	After a full week of classes, there is always a weekly contest in their Residential Care institution that adolescents are incentivized to participate together with friends they make in school. The contest winners are rewarded with more pocket money. 

In-game days are broken down in two types of stages: the classes and the class breaks. During classes, teachers speak about emotions, sometimes presenting useful information for the students while other times asking questions that can give points and boosts to players. During breaks, the players can explore the school and talk with other colleagues, in order to strengthen relationships with them and find out more about their skills, in order to choose who are the best teammates for the next school contest.

To ensure replayability, the player character’s classmates will have their skills and interactions randomized everytime a new playthrough is initiated. Each playthrough lasts five in-game weeks, after which the game ends and the player’s choices and interactions reflect on their final score.

There are no known games for promoting Emotion Regulation in adolescents in Residential Care, so this game aims to be the first Serious Game for this specific group.
