# Development Log
## Sprint 0 (03/04-10/04)
### Objectives
The objective of this sprint was not only to initially test the chosen technologies and determine if any adjustment was needed, but also to assess how much time tasks would take, for reference in future sprints. The main objective was also to kick-off the project, implementing the basic logic which will be developed over future sprints.
### What Was Done
This first sprint kicked off the project and consisted on the first development week, where the project was configured and initial basic features were implemented, as well as some key features of the game started their implementation. Namely:
- Player Movement and Animation are implemented
- Joystick and Interact Button UI are implemented
- Collisions are implemented
- Classmate Base Logic is implemented. Classmate characters are not yet defined. For now, a test classmate was created to ensure features are working before implementing each of the characters of the game separately, once the logic is ready.
### What Went Well
- Good Time Management allowed to accomplish all tasks, but they were all fairly simple, as it is the begginning of development.
- Documentation and Development Reference research was easy, as there are many materials for using Unity.
### What Needs to Change/Improve
- There were some problems integrating the animation of the test character sprite, and that must be corrected in future sprints.
- Detection and Interaction code requires some additional testing and might require a refactoring.

## Sprint 1 (10/04-24/04)

Sprint 1 finished the implementation of the core mechanics of the game, focusing specifically on dialogue boxes and choices. Additionally, some progresses were made towards the Main Menu UI.

### What Was Done
- Dialogue Boxes
- Main Menu UI

### What Went Well
- Good Time Management allowed to accomplish all mechanics revolving around dialogue and led to UI related features being added mid sprint.

### What Needs to Change/Improve
- Dialogue was not as quick to implement as initially foreseen, leading to the decision to move the implementation of the Pause Menu to the next sprint's backlog. Situations like this are to be avoided in the future.

## Sprint 2 (25/04-08/05)

Sprint 2 focused on building the gameplay by developing features related to School Break scenes inside the game, as well as transitioning between those scenes. New UI elements were also introduced, both for these features and for others.

### What Was Done
- Pause UI
- Break Timer UI
- Updated Dialogue UI
- Updated Main Menu UI
- Break->Class and Class->Break Transitions

### What Went Well
- Good Time Management allowed for all selected features to be done in time and for some adjustments and fixes to previously implemented features.

### What Needs to Change/Improve
- Some requirements regarding character cast and unlockable content need to be analyzed and decided upon for future sprints. It is important to decide what to prioritize next sprint, to ensure a demonstration version is ready soon.
    - Limitations were encountered regarding multiple character sprites that represent a bigger amount of time to be invested into adding multiple characters and animations to the game. This process needs to be as quick and simple as possible.
    - Interaction Scenes during Breaks still need to be implemented. It is important to think how to implement them in a way that the timer doesn't restart after an interaction ends.
## Sprint 3

Sprint 3 focused in incrementing both Static Scenes and School Break Scenes, while the Day Cycle logic was also being implemented. Additionally, logic and Day Outcome GUI was also developed, as well as multiple bug fixes and adjustments done to increments of previous sprints. 

### What Was Done
- Created Unity Scenes for Static Scenes in each school room
- School Map Adjustments
- Interactive Doors for accessing rooms during School Breaks
- Coin System GUI and Logic
- Day Outcome GUI and Logic
- School Store GUI and Logic
- Started Using PlayerPrefs for Tracking Variables Needed in Multiple Scenes
- Adjustments to Dialogue GUI and Logic Refactoring
- JSON Parser for Reading Interactions and Converting them in Game Objects
- Added at least one interaction for each school room

### What Went Well
- This Sprint was one of the most productive so far, with many features being incremented or implemented on it.

### What Needs to Change/Improve
- Some sections of code could use some refactoring for easing updates when necessary.
## Sprint 4

The aim for Sprint 4 was finally achieving the MVP of Emotion Rush, by completing any mandatory features remaining in the product backlog in order to achieve the v1.0 release of Emotion Rush, the first playable version of the game. As planned, there were not that many features left implementing, so the rest of the Sprint was spent testing the game, fixing any encountered bugs and making adjustments to ensure the best quality possible for the release, which resulted in the more stable v1.1, still in this Sprint.

### What Was Done
- Emotion Identification Segments Scoring and Feedback Logic
- Adjustments to Interaction Storage and Loading for Mobile Compatibility
- Main Menu GUI Improvements
### What Went Well
- Feature Implementation was handled very quickly, which allowed for polishing and bug fixing for a significant part of the Sprint, while also dedicating time to adding new content to the game.

### What Needs to Change/Improve
- While Emotion Rush is now ready for testing with healthcare professionals, it's important to make some additional tests to detect and solve any possible bugs, as well as working on updating code documentation as well as refactoring code that may be disorganized for facilitating future updates or changes that need to be done.
