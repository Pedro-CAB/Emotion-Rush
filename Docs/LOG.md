# Development Log
## Sprint 0 (03/04-10/04)
### Objectives
The objective of this sprint was not only to initially test the chosen technologies and determine if any adjustment was needed, but also to assess how much time tasks would take, for reference in future sprints. The main objective was also to kick-off the project, implementing the basic logic which will be developed over future sprints.
### What Was Done
This first sprint kicked off the project and consisted on the first development week, where the project was configured and initial basic features were implemented, as well as some key features of the game started their implementation. Namely:
- Player Movement and Animation are implemented
- Joystick and Interact Button UI are implemented
- Collisions are implemented
- Classmate Base Logic is implemented. Classmate characters are not yet defined. For now, a test classmate was created to ensure features are working before implementing each of the characters of the game separately, once the logic is ready.
### What Went Well
- Good Time Management allowed to accomplish all tasks, but they were all fairly simple, as it is the begginning of development.
- Documentation and Development Reference research was easy, as there are many materials for using Unity.
### What Needs to Change/Improve
- There were some problems integrating the animation of the test character sprite, and that must be corrected in future sprints.
- Detection and Interaction code requires some additional testing and might require a refactoring.

## Sprint 1 (10/04-24/04)

Sprint 1 finished the implementation of the core mechanics of the game, focusing specifically on dialogue boxes and choices. Additionally, some progresses were made towards the Main Menu UI.

### What Was Done
- Dialogue Boxes
- Main Menu UI

### What Went Well
- Good Time Management allowed to accomplish all mechanics revolving around dialogue and led to UI related features being added mid sprint.

### What Needs to Change/Improve
- Dialogue was not as quick to implement as initially foreseen. Situations like this are to be avoided in the future.

## Sprint 2 (25/04-08/05)

Sprint 2 focused on building the gameplay by developing features related to static and explorable scenes inside the game, as well as transitioning between those scenes. New UI elements were also introduced, both for these features and for others.

### What Was Done
- Pause UI
- Break Timer UI
- Updated Dialogue UI
- Updated Main Menu UI
- Break->Class and Class->Break Transitions

### What Went Well
- Good Time Management allowed for all selected features to be done in time and for some adjustments and fixes to previously implemented features.

### What Needs to Change/Improve
- Some requirements regarding character cast and unlockable content need to be analyzed and decided upon for future sprints. It is important to decide what to prioritize next sprint, to ensure a demonstration version is ready soon.
    - Limitations were encountered regarding multiple character sprites that represent a bigger amount of time to be invested into adding multiple characters and animations to the game. This process needs to be as quick and simple as possible.
    - Interaction Scenes during Breaks still need to be implemented. It is important to think how to implement them in a way that the timer doesn't restart after an interaction ends.
